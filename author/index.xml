      <description>From Bacalar, we took a van to Mahahual. It was not very far and we had to spend half of the distance standing because the driver had picked up extra passengers on the way. That&amp;rsquo;s just how things were in Mexico and no one seemed to mind the mild chaos too much. It was similar to the chaos which most communal societies have.

      <description>The late night bus took an bee-lining route to Palenque. The direct route was one of those that were &amp;ldquo;not safe&amp;rdquo;. The morning vans went there with a convoy for security. This was the darker side of Chiapas, the land of Zapatistas, the rebellious natives and the scorn for capitalism. The longer route, however, was safe and come morning, we woke up in the beautiful Palenque.
Mayan Glory The apartment we had booked was nice and cozy.</description>
