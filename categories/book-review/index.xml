      <description>About Time: From Sun Dials to Quantum Clocks, How the Cosmos Shapes Our Lives - And How We Shape the Cosmos. Adam Frank by Adam Frank
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I learnt about this book from another pop-physics book that I had read, Lee Smolin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Trouble With Physics&amp;rdquo;. I never got around to getting to the book though. Recently I bought this book as a gift for a colleague and thought I would give it a shot first!</description>

      <description>Lord of the Flies by William Golding
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
This was another one that came out of the shelf cleaning session. It had been recommended to me a coupe of days earlier and had seemed extremely interesting so I took it up almost immediately. This was a paperback as well, an old copy with yellowing pages and the smell of old paper that I love. Tells you how books are a pleasure more than just reading.</description>

      <description>The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how I had come across this book but I think it was through a reference in another. Anyway, the title was quite interesting and I picked it bought it in my kindle library. I picked it up while I was backpacking and while I had intended to complete the book in the duration, it was not to be so.</description>

      <description>Demian by Hemann Hesse
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
In a recent cleaning exercise, out of the recesses of old bookshelves, came out this beauty. It had been a while since I had taken up a paperback and my current read, &amp;ldquo;The Man Without Qualities&amp;rdquo; seemed to be going nowhere. Since this seemed like a book that I could be done with a a few days, I decided to make it an interim read.</description>

      <description>Philosophy of Religion by John Harwood Hick
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I was advised about reading &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo; by an uncle of mine as a response to another post. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.</description>

      <description>Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell You by Devdutt Pattanaik
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
A friend recently told me that he had read Dr. Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jaya&amp;rdquo; and had found it quite interesting. I had been meaning to read it for some time and found myself browsing through the shelves of the bookstore at Jaipur airport for the book. Of course they had it, but another book caught my eye.</description>

      <description>The Glass Palace by Amitav Ghosh
My rating: 2 of 5 stars
I thought I had sworn off Ghosh for good. But an uncle (the same one who had lent me his copy of &amp;ldquo;In An Antique Land&amp;rdquo;) told me to pick this book since I was about to go to Burma. With a rather divided mind I eventually got a kindle version of this book and started reading it a few days prior to my departure to the &amp;ldquo;Land of Gold&amp;rdquo;.</description>
