      <description>Karan and I have been travelling for a year now. We left our jobs in Summer of 2018 to take a break from our overly hectic schedules in order to replenish. Since then we have biked for five months in the North Eastern states of India and we have backpacked in South East Asia, Europe and are currently in Mexico.
We started off with a lot of doubts:
Would I be able to bike all along?</description>

      <description>Ziro is not a music festival it is an experience
 A line we heard over and over by countless number of people. I will set a little background first. The only music festivals Karan and I have been to are NH7 and Supersonic and since we were based out of Pune these were not exactly &amp;ldquo;Outdoor Music Festivals&amp;rdquo;. So whenever someone said the above mentioned line I could only wonder what is so different.</description>
