<h2 id="guelaguetza-mexico">Guelaguetza, Mexico</h2>

<p>Our Mexico trip had one thing which was fixed on the agenda and it was Guelaguetza. The Guelaguetza, or Los lunes del cerro (Mondays on the Hill), is an annual indigenous cultural event in Mexico that takes place in the city of Oaxaca, as well as in nearby villages. The only impression we had of Mexico before reaching it was the colors and we did not want to miss a chance to attend one such colorful festival. We did have to cut our time short at a few other places to reach Oaxaca in time but it was what it was, couldn&rsquo;t have missed this.</p>

<p><strong>When did we attend it?</strong></p>

<p>4 days. July 22 - July 25, 2019</p>

<p><strong>Any dress code?</strong></p>

<p>Wear comfortable shoes and clothes as you would be walking a lot. The locals dress up in their traditional attire, if you are up for it you can buy some of the colorful(and expensive) handcrafts and wear the same. Most of the travelers(including us) were wearing what they felt comfortable in.</p>

<p>Keep an umbrella or raincoat handy. It rained almost every single day of the event when we were there 😕.</p>

<p><strong>How to enjoy Guelaguetza to the fullest?</strong></p>

<p>The most important thing that we wanted to attend was the parade of the delegations in Oaxaca centro. And in all our brilliance we did reach Oaxaca a day before the festival started so that any unfortunate event would not lead to us missing the parade. UNFORTUNATELY, the parade which we thought was on Monday, happened on Saturday. We reached early Sunday morning 😢. So plan for this, we have heard its a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Also, book your stay in advance. Most of the places in the city are pretty much booked for the event and you might end up staying far from the center where everything happens. Its well connected by buses though but still it&rsquo;s a hassle in the rains.</p>

<p>There is a Guelaguetza auditorium where all the cultural events happen. There is a published schedule that can be found online and there are free buses taking people to the auditorium for such events. We were quite bummed for having missed the parade which would have felt more personal and decided to ditch the auditorium celebrations which in our opinion would have felt much less intimate. We decided to stick to the city center and we were not disappointed at all.</p>

<p>The city center had lots of artisans market, supposedly on both the Mondays of the festival but we found these markets to be up and about almost everyday. This is a perfect place to buy some colorful things to take back home. Be it clothes, or small colorful animals, shot glasses, purses, jewellery, pottery, mezcal, etc. Basically imagine anything colorful and you would find it. And it would be really hard not to buy these things. So keep your shopping bag handy.</p>

<p>This market also has different kind of food from different regions. Make sure you try some of the delicacies. We had this one dish <strong>Dulces y Bunuelos</strong>, it was like the Indian bhatura with a sweet sauce on top of it given in a bowl. After you had finished eating you could either take the bowl away with you once or you can break it on a wall 😱. And there were so many people smashing their bowls on a wall. We watched curiously and laughing when the ladies on the next table said the bowls are not reused anyway, if we don&rsquo;t break them the shop owners will. OKAY!! They could also not break them and not reuse them, but where is the fun in that eh?</p>

<p>There are also many cultural events that take place in the city center at it&rsquo;s various stages. We had chosen the stage close to the <Cathedral name> as the one we visited everyday. The stage had delegations from regions around the state of Oaxaca who would sing and dance and usually showed the wedding traditions of their respective regions. It was fun to see the common theme between all of them was dancing after the ceremony was over. Some regions have really short wedding ceremony followed by longer celebrations while some have longer wedding ceremony and long celebrations. This is a fun event to watch and post the performance the delegations throw food packages in the air for the audience. It was fun to see people dive for these 😂. One of the groups even treated the audience with Mezcal 😁.</p>

<p>We also did something very unique. Something we would not have done had we been all by ourselves. Our hosts, Fernando and Mariana, asked if we were interested in watching a show at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teatromacedonioalcala/">Teatro Macedonio Alcala</a> or the theatre of performing arts. It was around Guelaguetza celebrations and it would be nice. We had nothing else to do in the night and it sounded economical enough so we went for it. It was so so so mesmerising. It had the same theme! People and life around the different regions of Oaxaca. The show also showcased a traditional Oaxacan wedding which Fernando and Mariana had told us about the night before and it was beautiful and amusing to put images to that story. So you can check what is on at the theater and buy the tickets online.</p>

<p>Lastly, make sure you spend at least one late night at the centro. There are people drunk on Mezcal partying. There is music, there is dance, there is street food, there are fireworks. And there is this big wooden effigy that you can pick up on your shoulders and dance with 😂. It&rsquo;s pure joy!</p>

<p><strong>How to move around during Guelaguetza?</strong></p>

<p>While you are in the city center it is best to be on foot.</p>

<p>To go to the Guelaguetza auditorium there are free buses that run from Centro, you can get those.</p>

<p>There are also buses that run for the other parts of the city if you are not staying at the center. We didn&rsquo;t so these buses were pretty useful to us.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s late in the night, you will mostly not find a bus but there will be multiple taxis to take you anywhere you want.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It was a lot of fun to have celebrated these festivals in their country of origin. We enjoyed this so much that we have decided to do this more often. Not only does it tell you a lot about the culture it also let&rsquo;s you enjoy like a local.</p>
