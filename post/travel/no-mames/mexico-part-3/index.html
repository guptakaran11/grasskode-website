<p>We took an ADO bus out of Oaxaca which would get us to San Cristobal de Las Casas overnight. Weirdly sleeper buses are not a concept out there but fortunately the ADO buses are comfortable enough to spend the night. Parul slept as soon as the bus hit the highway but I stayed up initially, trying to test my Spanish against a movie that was being played. Come morning, we were at our destination.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ahh-san-cristobal">Ahh! San Cristobal!</h2>

<p>We walked for around half an hour to get to our AirBnB. I think Parul has caught on to my fascination for walking; or maybe just given up on me 😛 The AirBnB was at quite a distance from the Zocalo in a secluded area. We saw a skateboard rink on the way and something that looked like a sports complex.</p>

<p>Our hostess, Rosario, welcomed us and allowed us an early check-in. She fed us some fresh quesadillas and tea while we chatted about India, China and other unrelated things. This was going to be our only interaction with her but we did not quite mind. The accommodation was a beautiful adobe house with it&rsquo;s independent access and we loved the look and feel of it. It had been a while since we had gotten time for ourselves 😄</p>

<p>We took a short nap and then headed to the centro. There was a certain expectation we had from this town. Every traveller we had met till now who had asked us for our plans sighed at the mention of San Cristobal de Las Casas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ahh! San Cristobal!&rdquo; they would all say and then their eyes would visibly twinkle and zone out. Their minds lost themselves to, what we supposed were, pleasant memories. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to love it there!&rdquo; they&rsquo;d finally say after a few moments with the broadest smile on their faces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This had happened too many times to be a personal experience of a traveller. It seemed to be the general sentiment of the traveller community in this country! It did not take us long to figure out why.</p>

<p>San Cristobal initially seemed to me to be a smaller version of Oaxaca City. But as I walked around, there seemed to be more and more to this small town. The centro was small and colourful which gave loads of opportunities for street photography. Characters from Middle Earth, Gandalf and elves, stood around, offering a picture with themselves in exchange for a tip. There were artists dressed as shamans and performing high energy dances for an awed audience. Street vendors sold clothes and items of food. Hippies sold chocolates and strummed their guitars. And of course there was the <em>cafe</em> and <em>xocolate</em> that Chiapas was so popular for. It was a little bit of everything stuck into the vibrant city center.</p>

<p>We checked out a couple of museums (as we must!). One of jade and another of cacao. Neither was mind-blowing but the jade one had a decent recreation of the tomb of Pacal that we would see later at Palenque. Then we walked around to the cathedrals which dotted each direction of the town. We climbed up the hill to the west of the city till Iglesia de San Cristobalito. In the retiring day, it was a nice climb which gave a beautiful view of the city. After dark we came back down and spent some more time at the centro before finally heading back to the AirBnB around 8 in the night. That too because the vegan lunch that we had had was not letting us sit and eat/drink in a cafe. We picked up some pizza and mezcal on the way back and finished <a href="TODO">Roma</a> before calling it a night.</p>

<h2 id="people-of-the-land">People of the Land</h2>

<p>The next morning we had scheduled a tour with <a href="TODO">Alex y Raul</a> to Zinacantan and Chamula. This was a culture tour and had come highly recommended by our hostess. We decided to give it a shot in order to understand the culture of the land better. Would definitely be something different from what we were used to.</p>

<p>We reached the Zocalo at 9:30 AM and were met by our guide, Cesar. The group was a small one. A four member family from Netherlands and the two of us. The tour started at Zinacantan, a community of Tsotsil speaking Mayans who had adopted Christ and his ways. We walked around the church first, which seems to form the crux of all towns in Mexico. There was a wedding going on and Cesar asked to to passively observe it from the side. Everyone here, Cesar explained, wore something like a uniform which was typical to their village. Every community or village in the area had it&rsquo;s own uniform of sorts so that you could immediately tell where the people were from by simply looking at them. This village had adopted Christianity widely and held on to a few traditions as well. They had their unique justice system headed by 3 elected judges from the village. The children went out to study and work. The village was liberal in many ways, the community system was strong and everyone devoted a year to community services. The customs of the village reminded me of the villages of Nagaland in many ways.</p>

<p>We went to visit a weaver family next. Every village had it&rsquo;s own typical designs and the women of the family weaved various articles using old techniques which made the production slow and laborious. Opening the house to tours was a way for them to gain supplementary income. They also fed us tortillas with a pumpkin seed powder that was utterly delicious! Parul bought a tote bag from the weavers on our way out. We headed to the van which ferried us to our next destination.</p>

<p>Chamula was a different part of the land and, as was to be expected, the clothes of the people here changed to reflect the change in location. The town was much bigger than Zicantan. The people here also spoke Tsotsil but were much more conservative about their traditions than the people of Zicantan. Cesar explained the various differences as we walked in front of the massive church and then took us inside, warning that the people here did not appreciate the camera so we had better put it away. It was an extremely surreal experience to walk in that church. The people had adopted the Christian God and saints but modified them to fit into their traditional belief. Candles burnt everywhere in the church and hay lined the floors. People sat chanting and shamans carried out rituals to heal the sick. The Vatican had tried interfering a few times to establish it&rsquo;s version of Christianity but the locals had violently repelled it away.</p>

<p>Cesar took us to see a spiritual leader next. These were people who served the community and were selected based on application. They held special positions in the society but a lot of them had to save their entire lives to gather the funds required for a year long service as a spiritual leader. As the incense burnt and the spiritual leader chanted to gods hidden behind veils of leaves, Cesar commented on how this village had it&rsquo;s own way of functioning. How traditional medicine was still used here and was claimed to work. But missionaries from USA came and tried converting these people to their faith. The justice system here was orthodox but effective. Severe crimes were punished by lynching and moderate ones by public shaming. At many levels, I agreed with what Cesar was saying. The village had it&rsquo;s right to exist in the manner that it wished to. Modernization would bring about many changes for sure but adopting those changes was a choice of the natives. It should not be forced on them.</p>

<p>This strong hold on the traditional way of life was probably the reason that <a href="TODO">Zapatistas</a> were rooted in Chiapas. They were a bit like Naxalites in India (TODO), only much less political and much more supported by the local communities.</p>

<p>We thanked Cesar for the wonderful tour as he dropped us back to the city center. Then we had a wonderful lunch of soups in a restaurant where two old men played a xylophone like instrument that we had been seeing since Oaxaca.</p>

<p>We went back to the room and after resting a while we left for some Mexican food in a nearby restaurant followed by some drinks in the Zocalo. San Cristobal had our hearts ❤️</p>

<h2 id="change-in-the-itinerary">Change in the Itinerary</h2>

<p>We had a flight out from San Cristobal to Merida but we decided that we were rushing things too much. We had been having active days ever since Zicatela and both of us wanted to rest for a day or two. Plus, we wanted to see Palenque as well and had we gone to Merida as planned, Palenque would become too off route to pursue. So we decided that the flight was cheap enough to give a miss and extended a day in San Cristobal. This was today, when we decided to take it easy and do as little as we could.</p>

<p>We woke up to the chirping of birds in the fallow land next to our property. I spent many a minutes trying to click an elusive hummingbird with my zoom lens. The flora and fauna of Mexico is starkly different from Asia&rsquo;s and it is a treat in itself. We also went to check out the Museum of Mayan Medicine which was on the other side of the town. This was strictly okay but we managed to have <em>tamales</em> on the way. This staple dish is somewhat like upma and best had roadside with the corn drink <em>atole</em>. I made do with some coffee though.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Parul went for a nap and I sat in a cafe editing pictures and drinking more coffee with chocolate. Towards the evening we returned to the AirBnB and I decided to go for a run in the sports complex next to the place. This was the SEDEM park and seemed to be quite a elaborate public amenity with football fields, a jogging track, basketball courts and more. I ran a disastrous few laps and cursing myself for the bad shape I had gotten into, returned to the room. My phone had been misbehaving for a few days now and the battery finally died during the run. Frustrated, I swore off Motorola phones.</p>

<p>That night we went back to the city center to book a tour of the Sumidero Canyons and then book a ticket to Palenque with ADO. After getting done with all the bookings, we sat at <a href="TODO">TierrAdentro</a>, a Zapatista cafe that Dahlia had suggested. Like all her suggestions, this turned out to be pretty amazing. There was live music, okay food and lots of drinks during the happy hours 😄</p>

<h2 id="doing-it-all-wrong">Doing it All Wrong</h2>

<p>The next morning we packed up and waited in front of the SEDEM gate for the tour company to pick us up. We eventually got into a van full of Mexicans and headed to the <strong>Sumidero Canyons</strong> It seemed slightly odd to begin with but that was just because we were not used to tours. The driver ranted off information about the canyon in rapid Spanish and I tried to catch some words here and there. Once we reached the jetty, we were transferred into a motorboat and thus started two hours of the canyon tour.</p>

<p>The canyon was grand! Cliffs rose on both side and it seemed like a scene out of Jurassic Park. There were strange formations on the cliff and the boat guide described these in rapid Spanish. We used to stop often at such &ldquo;points of interest&rdquo; and click pictures or benefit from the guide&rsquo;s knowledgeable rant. There were small caves and stalactites hanging from them. Egrets, pelicans and vultures flew around. It was quite surreal. Of course, there was the plastic pollution floating in the water and the strong smell of diesel to remind you that you were still in the present age and world.</p>

<p>Our motorboat, like many others around, zoomed through the canyon and reached the other side. Here some boats selling food and drinks hooked on to ours while people made their purchases.</p>

<p>Then we zoomed back the way we had come and stopped at a spot to see some monkeys and admire a crocodile basking in the sun at close quarters. Then the boat whirred it&rsquo;s way back to the jetty where we got off.</p>

<p>The tour would have been great &hellip; except &hellip; I had this constant feeling that we were doing it all wrong! Parul and I chatted at the end of the tour and she was feeling the same way. We should have been in kayaks, slowly making our way through the canyon. But a kayak or row-boat would have taken too long and who has the time these days? Get in a speed boat that noisily rushes through the canyon. Who cares about the fauna being disturbed by the sound or the rippling water or the smoke of the diesel engines? See everything in a rush, go click-click and leave with a bucket list tick. Mass tourism is a menace indeed! This could have been so much better. Too bad that it wasn&rsquo;t but we learnt to trust our guts for the next time. We had been super indecisive about the canyons and we now realised it was for good reason. We also decided to be more responsible in the future.</p>

<hr />

<p>The rest of the day was all about killing time till our bus later that night. I got my phone in working condition by a local repair center (there are no official Motorola repair centers in the whole of Mexico 😑). It was working now and I just hoped that it lasted till the end of the trip. We sat at a Starbucks to use their good internet and worked on the blogs. Eventually it was time for the bus and we headed to the ADO bus stand right outside the town center.</p>
