<p>The late night bus took an bee-lining route to Palenque. The direct route was one of those that were &ldquo;not safe&rdquo;. The morning vans went there with a convoy for security. This was the darker side of Chiapas, the land of Zapatistas, the rebellious natives and the scorn for capitalism. The longer route, however, was safe and come morning, we woke up in the beautiful Palenque.</p>

<h2 id="mayan-glory">Mayan Glory</h2>

<p>The apartment we had booked was nice and cozy. We walked to it since a half hour walk was nothing we were averse to by now. Our host explained things to us, gave us a bunch of recommendations and left us to ourselves. It was a whole apartment with a functional kitchen, an air-conditioned bedroom and a clean bathroom. What more could a traveler want ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>We went to see the Palenque ruins that morning. We freshened up and then walked out of the apartment. Our host had told us where we could get a <em>colectivo</em> for the ruins and we found one waiting there. We got in and a short ride through a beautiful road got us to the <em>Zona Archeologica</em> TODO of Palenque.</p>

<p>We bought the tickets and denied the guides who were explaining the site to us. These sites would definitely make more sense with someone to explain the history of the place but we were on a budget that did not allow such luxuries. Getting a guide would have meant cutting down on a whole lot else. So we contended ourselves with admiring the beauty, making sense from the short descriptions written here and there and imagining as much as we could.</p>

<p>The Palenque ruins were much more beautiful than the ones we had seen as yet - Teotihuacan and Monte Alban. There was a lot of restoration done which helped us imagine what the place would have been like in it&rsquo;s glory. The murals were recreated and the descriptions told a story.</p>

<p>The only bummer was the oppressive humidity and heat so we took it slow and easy and did as much as felt comfortable. Then we wandered off into the forest surrounding the site. The forest was probably what made the site so beautiful. We walked around amidst ruins that were not marked. We even spotted a keel-billed Toucan and a black squirrel avoiding attention ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>Back near the visitor center, we spent some time in the museum and saw Pakal&rsquo;s grave. The recreation at the Jade Museum in San Cristobal de Las Casas that we had seen earlier seemed pretty accurate now.</p>

<p>We headed back to the centro and had a funny episode where we walked into a Chinese restaurant and tried conversing in Spanish with the Chinese lady to figure out if she had vegetarian food or not ðŸ˜‚ The dinner was made in the rare luxury of the kitchen and after watching <a href="TODO">Andhadhun</a> I was dazed enough to fall asleep.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-the-heat">Dealing with the Heat</h2>

<p>The next morning we woke up later than planned. While we had initially planned to just spend a day in Palenque, we decided to extend it to two. The relaxing apartment was partially responsible for it and the other reason was that I was quite excited about the <strong>Roberto Barrios</strong> cascades that our host had described as <em>unique</em>. After cooking and and eating some breakfast, we headed to the market to get a <em>colectivo</em> for the cascades.</p>

<p>Parul had not shared my enthusiasm for the cascades since the morning. Partly because of the hot weather and partly because the idea of &ldquo;another waterfall&rdquo; did not seem exciting to her. Meghalaya and South-East Asia had presented us with enough waterfalls to raise our bar for what exited us and what did not. I offered that she sit it out and chill in the centro but she did not take take option as well. Her mood was visibly sullen during the hour it took us to find a van and another on the road to get to the cascades. We bought a ticket and then went to check out the <em>cascadas</em>.</p>

<p>My first impression was that this was a slightly more spread out version of <em>Kuang Xi</em> (Luang Prabang, Laos). The water was not as surrealistically blue but the surrounding area was much less touristy. It was mostly a jungle with trails leading down by the sides of the cascades. There were a few tourists scattered here and there but not a lot.</p>

<p>We went down a couple of levels and found a nice pool where I wanted to take a dip. Parul joined in after much hesitation. Her mood visibly lightened once she got into the water ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>There were ropes drawn across the pool. Apparently Mexicans share the same problem as Indians with regards to swimming skills. There were shaded spots where we lounged and the water&rsquo;s temperature was extremely relaxing in the hot weather. The cascades formed infinity pools at every level and it was a delight to see. There seemed to be no end to these cascades!</p>

<p>We took a lot of pictures and swam around in the pool for the better part on an hour. I even jumped off a tree near the pool surface ðŸ˜… It was mighty fun!</p>

<p>The crowd increased as the day progressed and here I had thought we were late! We walked off to explore more cascades and saw some small ones hidden away in the forest. I have no idea how much of the whole thing we actually witnessed ðŸ˜±</p>

<p>We exited and got a refreshing serving of mangoes and coconut at the exit. These guys put salsa on everything ðŸ˜‘ I had some grilled chicken with rice for lunch and then we found a van to take us back to the town.</p>

<p>We ended the night with some <em>micheladas</em>, mezcal and another movie. It had been a fun couple of days in Palenque.</p>
