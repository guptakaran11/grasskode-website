<p>Karan and I have been travelling for a year now. We left our jobs in Summer of 2018 to take a break from our overly hectic schedules in order to replenish. Since then we have biked for five months in the North Eastern states of India and we have backpacked in South East Asia, Europe and are currently in Mexico.</p>

<p>We started off with a lot of doubts:</p>

<p><strong>Would I be able to bike all along?</strong> <br />
To think of it the only other bike trip I had done was to Jaisalmer<add link>. And this was not going to be a cakewalk.</p>

<p><strong>Would I be able to stay away from my job for so long?</strong> <br />
After all I had never done this before. For Karan it was the second time but for me it was a first.</p>

<p><strong>Will I even like it?</strong> <br />
I am used to comfort, a few weeks of backpacking is what I had done before but we were talking months here.</p>

<p>And the most important question of all,</p>

<p><strong>Will we be able to stand each other 24 hours a day everyday?</strong> <br />
We both like our space. Karan more than I do. I need my time after every few months when I don&rsquo;t want to do anything and just lie down and do nothing. Something Karan can&rsquo;t do at all. Karan likes his days alone, when he is undisturbed. Our work life was giving us this as I used to travel for work quite often and we used to both get our time. Plus we were never really together for 24 hours, except weekends maybe, which we loved because we had not had a lot of time together in the whole week. But now we were going to be together every single day. Travelling together and living everything together was going to be the new life. Could we do it?</p>

<p>The answer to everything is a big YES! For last one year we have biked in the North east of India. Backpacked in Cambodia and Laos. Had a fun couple of weeks catching up with friends in Europe. Spent time with family in US and are now backpacking in Mexico. It&rsquo;s been a year and we are still going on. This is our story so far.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h2>

<p>This was really going to be my first actual bike trip after <a href="http://grasskode.xyz/post/travel/firsts/ride-on/">Jaisalmer</a> which was on a perfect highway without any challenges. So clearly our first important milestone was getting to Tawang. The road till Assam was fairly good. Karan has been an avid biker for years now. His Royal Enfield Thunderbird 500, our first child, lovingly known as Typhon had clocked 50K kms on the odometer. Our second child, Ifrit, is a flaming red Royal Enfield Electra 350, which rides with me. Clearly his machine was more powerful than mine and could run way over 100km/hr easily. Ifrit and I could be 70km/hr effortlessly and post than everything usd to start vibrating. The engine was not tuned enough yet for those speeds. So the first thing on my mind was I am slowing the Karan and Typhon down. But as always both of them were extremely supportive and were always watching out for us from the shoulder.</p>

<p>We had reached West Bengal from Delhi in 5 days and the night was supposed to be spent in Kurseong, a hill station a few kms short of Darjeeling. We were on our way to our lodge when on a winding road a sumo going downhill cut it too close to my bike and I lost control and fell. I screamed the same on the intercom and Karan told me he is coming. It was a slope, Ifrit was resting against the low ledge of the drain and it was almost impossible to pick it up alone. I had shut the engine down as the petrol was overflowing. The sumo behind the one who ran off stopped and two men came running to help me. I was trembling in shock so they moved me aside and handed the bike off to Karan who had come running by now. I had lost a bit of Ifrit&rsquo;s clutch handle. I was fighting back tears. I refused to take the bike up and Karan rode it up to a flatter spot. Karan held my trembling hand and asked what happened. I told him and he asked me to calm down. Eventually I got on the bike and we reached our beautiful lodge. This was my first fall!</p>

<p>After that things were fine and we had crossed the so called treacherous pass of Sela in Tawang. A lot of people had scared me and doubted my capability to drive on the road to Tawang, Karan was the only one who showed confidence. This was my personal victory and I was celebrating it with Karan. It was later when I read Karan&rsquo;s daily notes that there were some patches where he was worried how I would fare, he had fallen and risen on similar patches when he was new to biking. But I did it. I was so proud he was proud. We were making way to the center of Tawang when came the next fall. Again I was helped and we put the bike up on stand but this time I started crying. Karan was amazed and asked what&rsquo;s wrong and its normal to fall.</p>
