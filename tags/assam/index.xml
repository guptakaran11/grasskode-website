      <description>We had reached Guwahati after officially ending this spell of our biking in the North Eastern states. A lot many plans had been cooked up en route, almost on a daily basis. We had gotten a little tired of the mountains, the rickety roads and the repetitive scenery. A beach holiday had been discussed many a times but then there was also the peninsula trip I wanted to do and somewhere we had this feeling of wanting to complete the seven sisters and possibly their younger brother.</description>

      <description>Kaziranga National Park had been on my list for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to see the Greater Indian one-horned Rhinos. It was ideally supposed to be right after Ziro but due to rains the National park was closed. We made a trip to Kaziranga by the end of November, not long after the opening of the park. Besides being able to visit the park the other excitement was to be back on our bikes.</description>
