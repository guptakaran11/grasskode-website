      <description>Lord of the Flies by William Golding
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
This was another one that came out of the shelf cleaning session. It had been recommended to me a coupe of days earlier and had seemed extremely interesting so I took it up almost immediately. This was a paperback as well, an old copy with yellowing pages and the smell of old paper that I love. Tells you how books are a pleasure more than just reading.</description>
