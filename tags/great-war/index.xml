      <description>The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how I had come across this book but I think it was through a reference in another. Anyway, the title was quite interesting and I picked it bought it in my kindle library. I picked it up while I was backpacking and while I had intended to complete the book in the duration, it was not to be so.</description>

      <description>Demian by Hemann Hesse
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
In a recent cleaning exercise, out of the recesses of old bookshelves, came out this beauty. It had been a while since I had taken up a paperback and my current read, &amp;ldquo;The Man Without Qualities&amp;rdquo; seemed to be going nowhere. Since this seemed like a book that I could be done with a a few days, I decided to make it an interim read.</description>
