      <description>Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell You by Devdutt Pattanaik
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
A friend recently told me that he had read Dr. Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jaya&amp;rdquo; and had found it quite interesting. I had been meaning to read it for some time and found myself browsing through the shelves of the bookstore at Jaipur airport for the book. Of course they had it, but another book caught my eye.</description>
