      <description>We had been relaxing at Karan&amp;rsquo;s friend Rohit&amp;rsquo;s house in the far off district of Longding for a while now. After fattening ourselves with Yadavji&amp;rsquo;s delicious food everyday(read ROTI) we decided to finally leave the very beautiful Arunachal and head to Nagaland. My neck had been giving me troubles and after taking an extra day to recover I decided we were good to go. Yadav ji sent us off with curd and sugar (Dahi-Shakkar) ðŸ˜„.</description>

      <description>Kaziranga National Park had been on my list for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to see the Greater Indian one-horned Rhinos. It was ideally supposed to be right after Ziro but due to rains the National park was closed. We made a trip to Kaziranga by the end of November, not long after the opening of the park. Besides being able to visit the park the other excitement was to be back on our bikes.</description>
