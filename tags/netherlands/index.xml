      <description>Late September 2018, Priyanko and Di had informed us that a new addition to the Basu-Gupta family was expected. This meant that the family trip to Turkey that had been under consideration was no longer under consideration. While we would not have otherwise changed hemispheres during our travel, Parul and I decided to go to US to spend some time with the families. This is one of the agendas that our current jobless stint has - to spend some quality time with loved ones.</description>

      <description>The No Mames trip took us to Amsterdam to experience the King&amp;rsquo;s day. Through this post we plan to relive the crazy memories of the festival ðŸ˜„
What is it about Koningsdag or King&amp;rsquo;s Day â€” formerly known as Queen&amp;rsquo;s Day is the annual Dutch holiday in honor of King Willem-Alexander.
People dress up in orange, party, dance and get wasted. There are some concerts happening in some areas. There are flea markets and lot of street food and booze.</description>
