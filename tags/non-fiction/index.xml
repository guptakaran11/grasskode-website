      <description>About Time: From Sun Dials to Quantum Clocks, How the Cosmos Shapes Our Lives - And How We Shape the Cosmos. Adam Frank by Adam Frank
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
I learnt about this book from another pop-physics book that I had read, Lee Smolin&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Trouble With Physics&amp;rdquo;. I never got around to getting to the book though. Recently I bought this book as a gift for a colleague and thought I would give it a shot first!</description>

      <description>Philosophy of Religion by John Harwood Hick
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I was advised about reading &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo; by an uncle of mine as a response to another post. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.</description>

      <description>Shikhandi and Other Stories They Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell You by Devdutt Pattanaik
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
A friend recently told me that he had read Dr. Pattanaik&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jaya&amp;rdquo; and had found it quite interesting. I had been meaning to read it for some time and found myself browsing through the shelves of the bookstore at Jaipur airport for the book. Of course they had it, but another book caught my eye.</description>
