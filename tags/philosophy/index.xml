      <description>Slow Travel &amp;ldquo;Two months in Mexico! What are you guys planning to do for that long?&amp;rdquo;
I would usually shrug my shoulders and give a sheepish smile at the question whenever it came up. Yes, two months seems like a long time but once we started researching, it actually felt somewhat short. In the last 40 days that we have been in Mexico, we have come to know that 2 months is not even enough to scratch the surface of this huge country.</description>

      <description>The Man Without Qualities by Robert Musil
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite remember how I had come across this book but I think it was through a reference in another. Anyway, the title was quite interesting and I picked it bought it in my kindle library. I picked it up while I was backpacking and while I had intended to complete the book in the duration, it was not to be so.</description>

      <description>Demian by Hemann Hesse
My rating: 4 of 5 stars
In a recent cleaning exercise, out of the recesses of old bookshelves, came out this beauty. It had been a while since I had taken up a paperback and my current read, &amp;ldquo;The Man Without Qualities&amp;rdquo; seemed to be going nowhere. Since this seemed like a book that I could be done with a a few days, I decided to make it an interim read.</description>

      <description>Philosophy of Religion by John Harwood Hick
My rating: 3 of 5 stars
I was advised about reading &amp;ldquo;Philosophy of Religion&amp;rdquo; by an uncle of mine as a response to another post. I had put it on my reading list and even got myself a copy but the dry schoolbook-like text had put me off the task of reading it for quite a while. Eventually I did get to it.</description>
