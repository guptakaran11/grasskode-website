      <description>This is the second blog in a two part photoblog series. Read the first one here. It was all about the beaches and mountains that Cambodia has to offer. ðŸ˜„
We left Koh Rong Samloem after spending seven days in bliss on the paradise island. I would have loved to stay longer but we had an interesting appointment to keep. Papa and Chachu were coming to Phnom Penh to join us for a short duration of our travel.</description>

      <description>Parul and I travelled to USA in the May of 2017. It was not a vacation, rather some family time coupled with remote working. I managed to see three very distinct parts of the huge country with very different weather, sceneries, people and food. Here is an attempt to document it all in a photo-blog.
The Banks of Hudson This was the second time I was coming to Jersey City.</description>
