      <description>A few weeks back, Aniket asked me if I wanted to write an introduction for his new book. I did not have to think twice to know that I definitely wanted to write something. It had been a long time since I had something definite to write about and it was probably the first time I was writing for someone else. I was thrilled, to say the least.
The piece did not come easy though.</description>
