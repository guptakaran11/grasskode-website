      <description>I had put in my papers earlier this year and took off work in May. The idea was (and still is) to explore the alternation as a way of life. I find it hard to do things half-heartedly so I give it my all when I am in a job, consequently burn myself and then I think I owe myself some time off in order to explore other things in life and to help myself see a grander perspective.</description>

      <description>Ziro is not a music festival it is an experience
 A line we heard over and over by countless number of people. I will set a little background first. The only music festivals Karan and I have been to are NH7 and Supersonic and since we were based out of Pune these were not exactly &amp;ldquo;Outdoor Music Festivals&amp;rdquo;. So whenever someone said the above mentioned line I could only wonder what is so different.</description>
